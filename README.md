# S OS
another simple/stupid/suck project  
this time i decided to learn assembly by writting a OS  
## build and run
you will need `nasm` to build and `qemu` to run the OS  
to build just run `./build`  
to run just run `qemu-system-x86_64 -fda disk.img`
> [!WARNING]  
> DO NOT RUN IT ON REAL HARDWARE. i havent test it on real hardware so please dont do it unless you want a broken pc.
